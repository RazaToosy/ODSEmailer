# ODS Emailer

Takes csv files which contains data for multiple surgeries and splits them into surgery specific data to email this content to the associated practice.

- Create a folder called Surgeries off the Application Folder
- Create a csv file called Surgeries.csv
- 1st Column is ODS Code
- 2nd Column is the email linked to this practice code

The csv file you are processing must have the first column as the same ODS code relevant to the surgery

Thanks to Jack Ukleja who worked with me on this project during a NHS Hack Day.
